# Core Concepts

LunivCore leverages the performance benefits of C while providing the scripting flexibility of Lua.

- **Host Language (C):** Manages memory and executes computationally intensive tasks.  
- **Guest Language (Lua):** Provides a clean, dynamic scripting interface (the DSL) that communicates with C via a defined API.  
- **The Glue:** The Lua C API acts as the bridge, passing data back and forth efficiently.
