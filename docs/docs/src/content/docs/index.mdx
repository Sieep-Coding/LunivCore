# The Problem We Solve
Enterprise BI tools like Tableau, PowerBI, and Looker are powerful but fundamentally flawed for engineering teams:

- Black-box calculations prevent version control and peer review
- Vendor lock-in makes migration prohibitively expensive
- Slow deployment cycles require specialized BI engineers
- Limited extensibility for custom algorithms and domain logic
- High TCO with licensing, infrastructure, and training costs

LunivCore is built for engineering teams who demand **source code** rigor applied to **analytics**.

# The LunivCore Advantage
<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="C-Level Performance" icon="rocket">
    Subsecond queries on billion-row datasets. No interpreted overhead. Native memory efficiency means analytics on resource-constrained infrastructure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Control Your Data" icon="document">
    Reports are code. Git diff your analytics. Review changes before deployment. Audit every calculation modification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer-First Design" icon="pencil">
    Markdown-inspired `.lcore` syntax. Lua scripting for logic. No drag-and-drop complexity. Engineers ship faster.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy Anywhere" icon="seti:folder">
    Lightweight C core (< 5MB). Runs on servers, edge devices, embedded systems. Perfect for SaaS, edge analytics, and IoT.
  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

# See It In Action

<Tabs starlight>
    <TabItem label="LCore DSL">
        Write analytics like code, with clean syntax:

    ```bash
    dataset Sales "Q1 Revenue by Region" {
        APAC: 2850000
        EMEA: 1920000
        Americas: 3450000
        Other: 480000
    }

    plot Sales as bar

    view MarketShare "Revenue Distribution (%)" {
        APAC: 38
        EMEA: 25
        Americas: 45
        Other: 6
    }

    plot MarketShare as bar

    ```

    #### Outputs:

    ```text
    --- Q1 Revenue by Region ---
    APAC       | ███████████████████████████████████████ (2850000)
    EMEA       | ████████████████████████ (1920000)
    Americas   | ███████████████████████████████████████████ (3450000)
    Other      | █████ (480000)
    ----------------

    --- Revenue Distribution (%) ---
    APAC       | ███████████████████ (38)
    EMEA       | ████████████ (25)
    Americas   | ██████████████████████ (45)
    Other      | ███ (6)
    ----------------
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Lua Integration">
   Embed in applications or build complex logic:

    ```lua
    local sales = BI.new("YoY Growth Analysis")

    local current_revenue = 8700000
    local last_year_revenue = 6840000
    local growth_rate = ((current_revenue - last_year_revenue) / last_year_revenue) * 100

    if growth_rate > 20 then
        sales:add("Status", "High Growth")
        sales:add("Growth Rate (%)", growth_rate)
        sales:add("Projected Next Year", current_revenue * 1.25)
    else
        sales:add("Status", "Monitor")
        sales:add("Growth Rate (%)", growth_rate)
    end

    sales:plot()
    ```
    
    ```lua
    local dataset = BI.new("Q1 Aggregation KPIs")

    dataset:add("North", 340)
    dataset:add("South", 210)

    print("Total:", dataset:sum())
    print("Average:", dataset:avg())
    print("Min:", dataset:min())   
    print("Max:", dataset:max())
